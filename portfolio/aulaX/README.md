## aulaX ##

In 2025, as part of a personal project (afdata.uy -1-) that I began developing, hosted on my favorite hosting platform (iFastnet -2-), I implemented an LMS called aulaX -3- using MOODLE -4-.

The idea is to reserve this space to provide training services while also hosting project documentation.
