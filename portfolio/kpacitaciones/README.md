In 2024, _CRAMI IAMPP_ -1- assigned its Breastfeeding Commission the goal of having the institution certified by the _Ministry of Public Health (MSP)_ for its commitment to _GAP (Good Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices -2-)_ and the promotion of breastfeeding.

Part of the strategy required training a large number of staff members in a very short time. I was responsible for providing them with logistical advice and technical support in the development of two training solutions.

Also, from my role in the IT Infrastructure Department, I put a Linux server running a Moodle platform into production. "kpacitaciones.crami.com.uy" -3-

Although I left the institution in 2025, this tool remained available for use.
